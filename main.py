This is code aimed to help students in COMP 143 Spring 2024

Venture through the files and run through the code and mess with it and see what happens

Everything is commented but if you have any questions about something, do reach out.
Also, I recommend you comment your code so that you can look back at it and understand what is going on
instead of needing to go back through and predict it again.

If you want more information that is here, check out the book listed below as a resource.
I recommend going through the book and just printing out the examples it gives. It may be tedious,
but one of the main things you need to be able to do is to predict what the code is going to do.
Code works slightly differently than our brains, so it may do something different than we expect if we
do not try it out first.
