"""
This is code aimed to help students in COMP 143 Spring 2024

Venture through the files and run through the code and mess with it and see what happens

Everything is commented but if you have any questions about something, do reach out.
Also I recommend you comment your code so that you can look back at it and understand what is going on
instead of needing to go back through and predict it again.
